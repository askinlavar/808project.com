      <h5 class="w3-center">In Service since 2004</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">The owners of this restaurant are Josiah Go and Mellissa Duana. They met in 2002 and became business partners. Both of them are very interested in business and food which is why they came up with the idea of a restaurant. After 2 years, they finally opened 8088 Grill Restaurant.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">This restaurant promotes and supports more local food. Many restaurants today serve international dishes because the colonizers influenced the Filipinos during the colonization period. There are more and more international restaurants starting to spread here. We want to preserve local food or the Filipino Cuisine so that it will not be forgotten after many generations. Our restaurant is based on Filipino Cuisine. We serve meals such as silogs, kaldereta, sisig, and more. We also serve beverages such as soda, juice, and alcoholic drinks. Come here to taste many of our countries delicious meals.</p>

<br>
<p class="w3-large">One of our specialties here is our Tapsilog because most customers tends to buy this due to our large serving of the meat and that cooking our tapsilog takes time however it is worth the wait because we serve it with perfection the cost of this item may seem to be over price but it is worth buying. Another thing that we have is our sisig because most customers tends to want this as a side dish when they are drinking at night with their friends and that our sisig can either be pork or tuna buit for all of you out there we recommend you to buy pork since  it has most the crunch.</p>

<p class="w3-large">The best time to come here if you are a typical individual who is hungry and want something that’s worth the price is here in 808 grill because here we serve our customers with respect and that we serve him/her with a large amount of food serving because one serving of our foods is about good for 2 people, you can come here in the morning or in the afternoon for breakfast lunch and dinner, but if you are with friends and you guys want a good drink this is the place for you the time to go here is at night  our restaurant is open for 24/7 and that you can pretty much spend your night here buying our foods and that you could spend as much money you want here with getting the best cuisines, another thing I forgot to mention is that we have our specialty called the crispy pata and that most of the customers who are here at night buy this on the menu because of how well done it is. </p>
