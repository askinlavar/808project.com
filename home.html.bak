   <p class="w3-large">The owners of this restaurant are Josiah Go and Mellissa Duana. They met in 2002 and became business partners. Both of them are very interested in business and food which is why they came up with the idea of a restaurant. After 2 years, they finally opened 8088 Grill Restaurant.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">This restaurant promotes and supports more local food. Many restaurants today serve international dishes because the colonizers influenced the Filipinos during the colonization period. There are more and more international restaurants starting to spread here. We want to preserve local food or the Filipino Cuisine so that it will not be forgotten after many generations. Our restaurant is based on Filipino Cuisine. We serve meals such as silogs, kaldereta, sisig, and more. We also serve beverages such as soda, juice, and alcoholic drinks. Come here to taste many of our countries delicious meals.</p>
